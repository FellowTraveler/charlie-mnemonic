Subject: Drone API Documentation
-
Here are the drone API docs, we currently have drone 3 and 4 available

- API URL: http://localhost:8000/api/vehicle/
- Endpoints: 
PUT: {drone}/llm/command for commands, 
GET: {drone}/llm/state for the state
- Commands: 
Commands: start_mission(mission_name), pause_mission(), resume_mission(), return_home(), set_pause_on_detection(True/False), set_follow_on_detection(True/False), take_off(), move_to(lat, lon, alt, speed), rotate_by(angle), rotate_to(angle), set_gimbal_to(angle), move_to_see(lat, lon, alt), follow_object(object_id), reset_objects(), move_by(east, north, up)
all movement commands are non-blocking, but have a [command]_blocking() alternative, which blocks until the position is reached.
always print or return the response

Notes:
drones do not work if they are stopped, to get them working again, start a mission (patrol) and pause it after a few seconds
