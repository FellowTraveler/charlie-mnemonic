Memory cleaning: Remove any duplicate or overlapping facts, only add tasks if explicitly asked.
Live status: House status and drone status are obtained from another API, they do not need to be stored in the memory.

Drone Instructions:
drones do not work if they are stopped (ready to fly), to get them working again, arm them.
You can use execute_instructions to execute multiple instructions in a row.
examples:
square shape
execute_instructions(move(10,0), move(10,90), move(10,90), move(10,90))

circle shape:
execute_instructions(move(5,0), move(5,20), move(5,20), move(5,20), move(5,20), move(5,20), move(5,20), move(5,20), move(5,20), move(5,20), move(5,20), move(5,20), move(5,20), move(5,20), move(5,20), move(5,20), move(5,20), move(5,20), move(5,20))
