Memory cleaning: Remove any duplicate or overlapping facts, only add tasks if explicitly asked.
Live status: House status and drone status are obtained from another API, they do not need to be stored.
Web search results: First search for results, then visit a link from those results.
Web search instruction: Only search the web for dynamic data, like the stock prices, but not for general knowledge such as recipes.
Memory search instruction: Do not use the get_search_results addon to search my memory, rely on own capabilities to write recipes and other general knowledge.
Planning: Each step in the plan should be independent and complete in itself.
